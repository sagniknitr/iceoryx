# Planned features

This list contains rather high-prio features that will most likely be implemented in the near future.

* Windows and Mac support
* Man page for RouDi and the runtime
* Request-response communication
* Support for multiple publishers on the same topic

## Out of scope

These are feature that are not in the focus of iceoryx. However if you have ideas or wishes and find them on this list,
feel free to start the discussion by raising a feature request anyway.

* Make iceoryx run on microcontrollers
